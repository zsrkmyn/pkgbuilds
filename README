This repo keeps some PKGBUILDs used by myself.

These PKGBUILDs are:

1. originally from AUR, and modified by myself to make it can be compiled successfully or suitable for my machine;
2. written by myself but won't upload to AUR due to my laziness or unseemliness of sharing;
3. totally differently from the AUR's ones for the same packages becasue the AUR's are awful AFAIC.
